# Problem

Vlad and I (Illia) found it very difficult to trade options and perpetual futures on other networks such as Solana and Ethereum. The main problem is usually high fees. Another problem is that such platforms are very difficult to access. At the same time, there are no such platforms present on the TON blockchain. Moreover, there are no real-world financial data streams (oracles) that could provide it. 

# Solution

We decided to create Nenuma which will provide Data Streams for other developers (Streams API). Also, we provided a reference contract for other developers to launch their binary options with us (Options API).

As of today, the system includes: Data Stream, Subscription Batch (for scaling), Session, Brokerage, Broker, Brokerage Account, and Cash-or-Nothing Option.

Please, watch a video with us to get to know more technical details (THE LINK). Also, make sure to visit the website that we show in our video (https://nenuma.telegram-mini-apps.manuvantara.com). We are also opening up our code on GitHub (https://github.com/dreamqip/nenuma) and FigJam so you can take a look at our brainstorming process, drafts, and some specifications of our current implementation.

# Market

The market is crazy. Especially with a sharp increase in the popularity of Telegram Mini Apps. Technically, we can reach to 900M people. We hope to start with a single binary option platform powered by us that will handle the first 1000 users. We are planning to expand by attracting other participants of the cryptomarket to start their options and futures platforms. They may come up with even more unique use cases using only Streams API. We will be collecting fees per request for our infrastructure usage.

# Testnet

This is the account of the Data Stream deployed to Testnet. It is managed by our publisher and provides on-chain data when the number of subscribers is > 0.
